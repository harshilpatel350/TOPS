    "### 1. Explain Key Statistical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean:\n",
    "The mean is calculated by summing all values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It provides a single value that represents the central tendency of the dataset. However, it can be heavily impacted by outliers or extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset that has been ordered from least to greatest. It represents the midpoint and is not easily affected by outliers, making it useful for skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mode:\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It indicates the most common value and is especially useful for categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range:\n",
    "The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It shows the total spread or variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance:\n",
    "Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies how much the data points differ from the average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It shows how much the values in a dataset typically deviate from the mean, using the same units as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is less affected by outliers than the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Skewness:\n",
    "Skewness measures the asymmetry of a data distribution. It indicates whether data is spread more to the left or right of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kurtosis:\n",
    "Kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of a distribution. It shows whether the data have heavier or lighter tails than a normal distribution, indicating the presence or absence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Percentage:\n",
    "A percentage expresses a part of a whole as a fraction of 100. It is used to represent proportions and compare values in a standardized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Percentile:\n",
    "A percentile is the value below which a given percentage of data points fall. It shows the relative standing of a value within a dataset."
